    <h3>ChromeOS Firmware Utility Script</h3>

    <p>
      The ChromeOS Firmware Utility Script simplifies the most common functions most users need when interacting with the firmware on 
      their ChromeOS device.  Currently, it allows the user to:
      <ul>
        <li>Install/Update the RW_LEGACY firmware with a newer/working/customized version of the SeaBIOS firmware payload</li>
        <li>Install/Update the BOOT_STUB firmware to enable booting directly Legacy Boot (using the same payload as RW_LEGACY)</li>
        <li>Install/Update a full custom firmware image (Full ROM), built from the latest sources</li>
        <li>Set the Boot Options (GBB Flags) (only for stock ChromeOS firmware)</li>
        <li>Set the device's Hardware ID (only for stock ChromeOS firmware)</li>
        <li>Restore the Stock BOOT_STUB firmware</li>
        <li>Restore the Stock firmware image</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      At startup, the Firmware Utility Script will automatically detect the ChromeOS device and current firmware type, and 
      restrict the available menu options based on this information.  An override is available for user who really know what they are 
      doing (or really want to try and brick their device - though the script will do its best to try and prevent you from doing this). 
      Because these operations are mostly being done to normally read-only parts of the firmware, the firmware write protect will 
      need to be removed for most of the script's functions.  This is documented for each function below, and the script will likewise 
      check the write-protect state for each function that requires it to be disabled.
    </p>

      To download and run this script, from a terminal/shell type:<br>
      <code>cd; curl -L -O http://mrchromebox.tech/firmware-util.sh && sudo bash firmware-util.sh</code>

    <h3>Script Functions Explained</h3>
    <p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Install/Update the RW_LEGACY firmware</strong>
          <p>
            This option performs two simple tasks: it sets the crossystem boot flag necessary to enable Legacy Boot mode, and it 
            installs an RW_LEGACY firmware update appropriate for the device.  Users will have the option to set the default boot 
            device (internal storage [default] or USB/SD); Haswell/Broadwell Chromebox users will also have the option to enable 
            "headless" (no display attached) booting, which is really only useful if you're going to run the box without a display 
            and connect remotely (eg, via ssh).  Changing either of these options requires re-running this script function.
          </p>
          <p>
            After updating the RW_LEGACY firmware, Legacy Boot Mode can be accessed via <span class="keystroke">[CTRL+L]</span> on 
            the Developer Mode boot screen.  It can also be set as the default by changing the GBB Flags via 'Set Boot Options' 
            feature below.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Supported Devices:</strong> <code>All Haswell, Broadwell, and Baytrail ChromeOS devices</code>
          </p>
          <p>
          <strong>Requires firmware write-protect disabled:</strong> <code>NO</code>
          </p>
      </li>
      <br>
      <li><strong>Install/Update the BOOT_STUB firmware</strong>
          <p>
            The BOOT_STUB update is slightly more complex under the hood, as it backs up the stock BOOT_STUB firmware to the unused 
            RW_LEGACY region (as RW_LEGACY is ignored when using a modified BOOT_STUB), but is equally straightforward.  As before, 
            users will have the option to set the default boot device (internal storage [default] or USB/SD); changing this option 
            requires re-running this script function.
          </p>
          <p>
            After updating the BOOT_STUB firmware, your device will be directly in Legacy Mode; ChromeOS will not boot (though it will 
            try to do so and fail, until a new OS is installed).
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Supported Devices:</strong> <code>Baytrail ChromeOS devices without a Full ROM firmware available</code>
          </p>
          <p>
          <strong>Requires firmware write-protect disabled:</strong> <code>YES</code>
          </p>
