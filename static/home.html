      <h3 id="top">Greetings fellow ChromeOS Enthusiasts!</h3>
      <p>
          This site is designed to provide background info on ChromeOS, Developer Mode, and Legacy Boot Mode, as well as info on modifying/replacing the the firmware on your device in order to better meet your needs.  If you're looking for information on how to run Linux (or Windows) on your ChromeOS device, you've come to the right place.
      </p>
      <p>
          It's also the home of the ChromeOS Firmware Utility Script and Kodi E-Z Setup Script, which simplify and automate many of the tasks required to run an alternate OS and/or Kodi Media Center on your Chromebook/Chromebox.

      <h5 id="top">A few bug fixes, plus Cloudready support</h3>(2016.07.20)
      <p>
          As is usual with changes of this magnitude, a small bug or two emerged (related to the Stock Firmware Restore functionality of the Firmware Utility Script) and were promptly fixed.  Also, support has been addded for Neverware's Cloudready OS, a ChromiumOS derivative.  It uses a slightly different partition layout than ChromeOS/ChromiumOS, and the scripts were not prepared for it.  Clouldready is handled the same as ChromiumOS - that is, ChromeOS-specific functions are still locked out/not available.

      <h5 id="top">New Site, New Firmware, New Script Functions! </h3>(2016.07.19)
      <p>
          Along with the revamped website, all firmware files have been rebuilt and updated using the latest sources.  Plus, Full ROM firmware has been added for several BayTrail Chromebooks (ENGUARDE, GLIMMER, GNAWTY, and SWANKY) with more to come in the near future.
      </p>
      <p>
          Additionally, the Firmware Utility Script's <strong>Restore Stock Firmware</strong> function has been updated to support all Haswell, Broadwell, and Baytrail ChromeOS devices - even if you don't have a backup file available.  The <strong>Restore Stock BOOT_STUB</strong> function has likewise been updated to support all Baytrail devices, even those flashed with BOOT_STUB firmware from another party.
