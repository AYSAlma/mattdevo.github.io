      <h3 id="top">Greetings fellow ChromeOS Enthusiasts!</h3>
      <p>
          This site is designed to provide background info on ChromeOS, Developer Mode, and Legacy Boot Mode, as well as info on modifying/replacing the the firmware on your device in order to better meet your needs.  If you're looking for information on how to run Linux (or Windows) on your ChromeOS device, you've come to the right place.
      </p>
      <p>
          It's also the home of the ChromeOS Firmware Utility Script and Kodi E-Z Setup Script, which simplify and automate many of the tasks required to run an alternate OS and/or Kodi Media Center on your Chromebook/Chromebox.  
      </p>

      <br>
      <h5 id="top">(Preliminary) Braswell support added</h3>(2016.07.30)
      <p>
         RW_LEGACY firmware support has been added for current Braswell-based Chromebooks (Celeron N3xxx models: CELES, CYAN, EDGAR, REKS, TERRA, ULTIMA).  I don't have confirmation of the eMMC and SD card controller addresses for all of them (only CYAN and EDGAR so far), so eMMC/SD might not show up in the SeaBIOS boot menu for some models.  In that case, drop me a line and I'll give you instructions to retrieve the firmware boot log, which will tell me the correct addresses.
      </p>
      <p>
          Unfortunately, Linux support for Braswell is still pretty spotty.  I was able to boot/install GalliumOS, but the keyboard, sound, touchscreen, and a few other things didn't work yet.  Wifi/BT worked fine, so an external keyboard was all I needed for it to be usable.
      </p>
      <p>
          Also, the syslinux bootloader used for installing LibreELEC in dual-boot and external USB configurations has been updated, as well as the flashrom binary used on non-ChromeOS/ChromiumOS systems.  Both were updated to add Braswell support, and didn't appear problematic on older platforms in my (albeit limited) testing here.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h5 id="top">Baytrail Windows Update</h3>(2016.07.24)
      <p>
         All Baytrail Full ROMs have been updated to fix the detection/operation of emmc/SD storage controllers by Windows, so you can now install Windows onto the internal emmc (or at least access it if booting from external media).  Unfortunately, the I2C bus functionality is not yet working, so an external mouse is required since the trackpad will be non-functional.  Baytrail Full ROMs are currently available for ENGUARDE, GLIMMER, GNAWTY, NINJA, QUAWKS, and SWANKY.  If you'd like support for your Baytrail Chromebook added, just let me know.
      </p>
      <p>
          Also, fixed an issue with the Firmware Utility Script's listing of available USB devices for firmware backup on ChromeOS devices with emmc internal storage (vs SSD).  Previously, the first USB device wasn't being displayed as the script assumed it was the internal ssd (and therefore excluded it).
      </p>

      <h5 id="top">A few bug fixes, plus Cloudready support</h3>(2016.07.20)
      <p>
          As is usual with changes of this magnitude, a small bug or two emerged (related to the Stock Firmware Restore functionality of the Firmware Utility Script) and were promptly fixed.  Also, support has been addded for Neverware's Cloudready OS, a ChromiumOS derivative.  It uses a slightly different partition layout than ChromeOS/ChromiumOS, and the scripts were not prepared for it.  Clouldready is handled the same as ChromiumOS - that is, ChromeOS-specific functions are still locked out/not available.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h5 id="top">New Site, New Firmware, New Script Functions! </h3>(2016.07.19)
      <p>
          Along with the revamped website, all firmware files have been rebuilt and updated using the latest sources.  Plus, Full ROM firmware has been added for several BayTrail Chromebooks (ENGUARDE, GLIMMER, GNAWTY, and SWANKY) with more to come in the near future.
      </p>
      <p>
          Additionally, the Firmware Utility Script's <strong>Restore Stock Firmware</strong> function has been updated to support all Haswell, Broadwell, and Baytrail ChromeOS devices - even if you don't have a backup file available.  The <strong>Restore Stock BOOT_STUB</strong> function has likewise been updated to support all Baytrail devices, even those flashed with BOOT_STUB firmware from another party.
