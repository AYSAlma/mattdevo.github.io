      <h3 id="top">Greetings fellow ChromeOS Enthusiasts!</h3>
      <p>
          This site is designed to provide background info on ChromeOS, Developer Mode, and Legacy Boot Mode, as well as info on modifying/replacing the the firmware on your device in order to better meet your needs.  If you're looking for information on how to run Linux (or Windows) on your ChromeOS device, you've come to the right place.
      </p>
      <p>
          It's also the home of the ChromeOS Firmware Utility Script and Kodi E-Z Setup Script, which simplify and automate many of the tasks required to run an alternate OS and/or Kodi Media Center on your Chromebook/Chromebox.

      <h5 id="top">New Script Functions: Remove/Restore ChromeOS Bitmaps</h5>(2016.09.06)
      <p>
         Lots of people use ChromeOS in Developer Mode, and the one thing they can all agree on is that the bright white Developer Mode boot screen is a retina-searing travesty.  To that end, I've added a new script function which removes the ChromeOS bitmap images used for the Developer Mode and Recovery Mode splash screens, which leaves your device with a simple and pleasant black screen with white text: 
      </p>
      <p><center><img src="../images/devmode_normal.png" style="max-width:40%;border:1px solid black">&nbsp;&nbsp;becomes&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="../images/dev_no_bmp.png" style="max-width:40%;"></center>
      </p>
      <p>
          If you want to restore the stock bitmaps, the <a href="javascript:document.getElementById('fwscript').click()">Firmware Utility Script</a> has you covered there too :)
      </p>
      <p>
          Edit: Sadly this doesn't work on Skylake Chromebooks, as they use a different method to render these bitmap images, and removing them from the firmware results in a solid white screen, not a solid black one.  
      </p>

      <h5 id="top">Legacy and UEFI Full ROMs added for all Haswell/Broadwell devices</h5>(2016.09.06)
      <p>
         Haswell/Broadwell device owners now have the option of flashing a Full ROM with either Legacy Boot (SeaBIOS) or UEFI Boot (Tianocore).  UEFI booting is needed/optimal for users who want to run Windows, OS X, or a multi-boot setup; Most Linux users will need to install a boot manager such as <a href="http://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/" target="_blank">rEFInd</a> since the UEFI firmware currently only looks for the default EFI boot path (EFI\BOOT\BOOTX64.EFI).  GalliumOS users will want to stick with the Legacy Boot option, since GalliumOS isn't UEFI compatible yet.
      </p>
      <p>
         All Full ROMs feature improvements to the SMBIOS tables, which fixes the amount of RAM reported to the system (mainly affected Windows and OS X).  Haswell/Broadwell Full ROMs also get fixes to the onboard audio, which improve the headphone jack detection/functionality, and fix the subsystem ID reported so that Windows will automatically install the correct drivers via Windows Update. Baytrail Full ROMs have been updated with a fix for battery status under Windows.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h5 id="top">Skylake RW_LEGACY support added</h5>(2016.08.05)
      <p>
         RW_LEGACY firmware support has been added for current Skylake-based Chromebooks (CHELL, LARS, SENTRY).  While these models may have included basic RW_LEGACY functionality stock, this improved version features proper video initialization in Legacy Boot Mode, resulting in the correct screen resolution being set (ie, text is more readable) and screen redraws are significantly faster (ie, instant).  And, like all firmware updates offered via the Firmware Utility Script, it allows the user to set their preferred boot device in Legacy Boot Mode (either internal storage or external USB/SD).
      </p>
      <p>
          Additionally, a Full ROM firmware was added for the 2014 Dell Chromebook 11 (CANDY), and several improvements were made to the script related to eMMC controller address support for Baytrail devices.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h5 id="top">(Preliminary) Braswell support added</h3>(2016.07.30)
      <p>
         RW_LEGACY firmware support has been added for current Braswell-based Chromebooks (Celeron N3xxx models: CELES, CYAN, EDGAR, REKS, TERRA, ULTIMA).  I don't have confirmation of the eMMC and SD card controller addresses for all of them (only CYAN and EDGAR so far), so eMMC/SD might not show up in the SeaBIOS boot menu for some models.  In that case, drop me a line and I'll give you instructions to retrieve the firmware boot log, which will tell me the correct addresses.
      </p>
      <p>
          Unfortunately, Linux support for Braswell is still pretty spotty.  I was able to boot/install GalliumOS, but the keyboard, sound, touchscreen, and a few other things didn't work yet.  Wifi/BT worked fine, so an external keyboard was all I needed for it to be usable.
      </p>
      <p>
          <strong>Update:</strong> another Braswell user tested Fedora 24 (Gnome, Cinnamon, MATE) and reported that the keyboard works properly, but not the trackpad (which isn't surprising, since GalliumOS uses a custom/ported ChromeOS driver for it); Ubuntu 16.04 wouldn't boot, but Mint 18 did (albeing without a working keyboard/trackpad).
      </p>
      <p>
          Also, the syslinux bootloader used for installing LibreELEC in dual-boot and external USB configurations has been updated, as well as the flashrom binary used on non-ChromeOS/ChromiumOS systems.  Both were updated to add Braswell support, and didn't appear problematic on older platforms in my (albeit limited) testing here.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h5 id="top">Baytrail Windows Update</h5>(2016.07.24)
      <p>
         All Baytrail Full ROMs have been updated to fix the detection/operation of emmc/SD storage controllers by Windows, so you can now install Windows onto the internal emmc (or at least access it if booting from external media).  Unfortunately, the I2C bus functionality is not yet working, so an external mouse is required since the trackpad will be non-functional.  Baytrail Full ROMs are currently available for ENGUARDE, GLIMMER, GNAWTY, NINJA, QUAWKS, and SWANKY.  If you'd like support for your Baytrail Chromebook added, just let me know.
      </p>
      <p>
          Also, fixed an issue with the Firmware Utility Script's listing of available USB devices for firmware backup on ChromeOS devices with emmc internal storage (vs SSD).  Previously, the first USB device wasn't being displayed as the script assumed it was the internal ssd (and therefore excluded it).
      </p>
      <br>
      <h5 id="top">A few bug fixes, plus Cloudready support</h5>(2016.07.20)
      <p>
          As is usual with changes of this magnitude, a small bug or two emerged (related to the Stock Firmware Restore functionality of the Firmware Utility Script) and were promptly fixed.  Also, support has been addded for Neverware's Cloudready OS, a ChromiumOS derivative.  It uses a slightly different partition layout than ChromeOS/ChromiumOS, and the scripts were not prepared for it.  Clouldready is handled the same as ChromiumOS - that is, ChromeOS-specific functions are still locked out/not available.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h5 id="top">New Site, New Firmware, New Script Functions! </h5>(2016.07.19)
      <p>
          Along with the revamped website, all firmware files have been rebuilt and updated using the latest sources.  Plus, Full ROM firmware has been added for several BayTrail Chromebooks (ENGUARDE, GLIMMER, GNAWTY, and SWANKY) with more to come in the near future.
      </p>
      <p>
          Additionally, the Firmware Utility Script's <strong>Restore Stock Firmware</strong> function has been updated to support all Haswell, Broadwell, and Baytrail ChromeOS devices - even if you don't have a backup file available.  The <strong>Restore Stock BOOT_STUB</strong> function has likewise been updated to support all Baytrail devices, even those flashed with BOOT_STUB firmware from another party.
