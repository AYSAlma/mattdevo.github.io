    <h3>Legacy Boot Mode</h3>
    <p>
      Legacy boot mode is an unsupported method for booting alternate OSes, such as Linux and Windows, available only on Intel/x86-based 
      ChromeOS devices (sorry ARM owners).  It is invoked by pressing <span class="keystroke">[CTRL+L]</span> on the Developer Mode boot 
      screen.  This key sequence directs the depthcharge firmware payload (which normally boots ChromeOS) to instead execute the payload 
      in the RW_LEGACY firmware region.  That payload (SeaBIOS) can then boot any Linux/Windows OS of your choice. Legacy Boot Mode 
      requires a functional RW_LEGACY firmware component, as well as the <code>dev_boot_legacy</code> boot flag to be enabled.  
      Otherwise, you will simply hear two beeps when pressing <span class="keystroke">[CTRL+L]</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Legacy Boot support via RW_LEGACY/SeaBIOS was first added with the 2013 Chromebook Pixel (board name: 
      <a href="https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/developer-information-for-chrome-os-devices/chromebook-pixel" 
      target="_blank">link</a>), and continued with the subsequent Haswell-based devices.  However, in many cases the SeaBIOS payload 
      included with the factory firmware had severe defects, ranging from no video output to non-functional USB ports.  In the case of 
      Baytrail-based devices, the RW_LEGACY firmware was not included at all.  Fortunately, an RW_LEGACY firmware update is available 
      for many models which correct these defects, offer improved funtionality, and add Legacy Boot Mode capability for previously 
      unsupported devices.

    <h3>Navigating SeaBIOS</h3>
    <p>
      Booting in Legacy Mode presents the user with the rather spartan looking SeaBIOS boot screen shown on the left below.  Pressing 
      <span class="keystroke">[ESC]</span> when prompted before the timeout (~3s) will display the boot menu shown on the right.<br> 
      <center><img src="../images/seabios_boot_1.png" style="max-width:47%;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      <img src="../images/seabios_boot_2.png" style="max-width:47%;"></center><br>
      With the boot menu displayed, simply press the number corresponding to the desired boot device. If the timeout occurs before 
      <span class="keystroke">[ESC]</span> is pressed, the boot device with the highest priority will be booted.  This is normally the
      internal storage (SSD or eMMC) unless the user has opted to default to USB when installing the firmware (this applies to all 
      firmware update types).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> If only one boot device is available -- either no USB/SD devices are attached, or they are not properly
      detected/initialized by SeaBIOS -- then the boot menu prompt ("Press ESC for boot menu") will not be shown, and the internal 
      storage will be booted.  In the case where ChromeOS is still installed/is the only OS installed, this can result in the screen 
      showing text indicating a kernel panic, or simply a blank screen.  If this happens, simply reboot and try using a different 
      USB/SD device to install/boot from.
