    <h3>ChromeOS Device Firmware</h3>
    <p>
      The firmware used by ChromeOS devices (with the exception of the first two or three models) is stored on an 8MB SPI flash chip
      and uses the layout shown below.  The shaded sections at the bottom are read-only, which is enforced by the firmware write-protect 
      screw on the main board.  When we talk about updating the firmware on ChromeOS devices, we're referring to either the RW_LEGACY or 
      (RO) BOOT_STUB sections, or to the entire firmware image (often referred to as a "full ROM").  Below we'll discuss these three update 
      types in more detail.

    <h3>Firmware Update Types</h3>
    <h4>RW_LEGACY</h4>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>Updates/replaces the stock legacy boot payload (SeaBIOS) included on many models; 
        supplements the ChromeOS / secure boot payload (BOOT_STUB)</li>
        <li>Leaves all stock functionality intact, including the developer mode boot screen and recovery mode</li>
        <li>Allows device to dual-boot another OS alongside ChromeOS</li>
        <li>Does not require disabling the firmware write-protect</li>
        <li>Carries zero risk of bricking the device</li>
        <li>On many models, includes bugfixes and enables additional functionality</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h4>BOOT_STUB</h4>
    <p>
      <ul>
          <li>Replaces the ChromeOS verified boot payload (depthcharge) with a legacy boot payload (SeaBIOS)</li>
          <li>Removes the developer mode boot (white "OS verification is OFF") screen</li>
          <li>Removes the ability to run ChromeOS, creating a small risk of bricking your device</li>
          <li>Requires the firmware write-protect screw to be removed</li>
          <li>Leaves the recovery mode ([ESC] + [REFRESH] + [POWER]) initiation functionality intact
            <ul type="square">
              <li>If you engage this key sequence, your device will try to boot into recovery mode, which no longer exists</li>
              <li>To escape the recovery mode "black hole", you will have to disassemble the device and briefly disconnect the battery</li>
              <li>TL;DR - be careful not to do it :)</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h4>Full ROM</h4>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>A complete firmware image which includes updated and/or customized versions of the hardware init  (coreboot) and 
        legacy boot payload (SeaBIOS) components contained in the stock firmware</li>
        <li>Removes the developer mode boot (white "OS verification is OFF") screen</li>
        <li>Removes the ability to run ChromeOS, creating a small risk of bricking your device</li>
        <li>Offers the best support for booting all OSes besides ChromeOS (including Windows)</li>
        <li>On many models, adds full hardware support for virtualization (vmx / VT-x)</li>
        <li>Fixes many bugs and/or idiosyncrasies associated with the stock firmware (but could potentially add new ones)</li>
        <li>Essentially turns your ChromeOS device into a "regular" PC / laptop</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p> 
      <br>All three firmware update types are available via the ChromeOS Firmware Utility script, though not all types are available for all devices.
