    <h2>Developer Mode Basics</h2>
    <p>Putting your ChromeOS device into developer mode relaxes some of the restrictions in the standard / verified boot mode, and gives the user a bit more control over the system:
    <ul>
      <li>Provides full root access to the system via a terminal shell</li>
      <li>Allows installation of Linux inside ChromeOS via crouton</li>
      <li>Allows for booting other operating systems via Legacy Boot Mode (aka SeaBIOS) on supported systems</li>
      <li>Allows for installation of custom firmware components (some of which require removing the firmware write-protect)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Because Developer Mode is inherently less secure than standard / verified boot mode, when powering on you will be greeted by the developer mode boot screen:

    <p>The dev mode boot screen will show for 30 seconds, then beep and boot into the (default) OS.  You can bypass this timeout by pressing [CTRL][D] to boot into ChromeOS, or [CTRL][L] to boot in legacy mode (SeaBIOS) if enabled.
    
    <h2>Enabling Developer Mode</h2>
    <p>On Most ChromeOS devices, entering Developer Mode requires you to first boot into recovery mode.  For Chromebooks, this means pressing [ESC][Refresh][Power]; On Chromeboxes, there is usually a physical recovery button (often a small hole above the SD card reader) which must be depressed when powering on.  Once at the recovery screen, press [CTRL][D] to enable Developer Mode, then confirm when prompted.  As a security measure, transitioning to/from Developer Mode will wipe out all ChromeOS user data, essentially resetting the device.
    <p>Exiting developer mode is as simple as following the instructions on the Developer Mode boot screen (usually pressing [SPACE]), but may require resetting the firmware boot flags if you've changed them.
